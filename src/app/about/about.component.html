  <h4>Funny story of how falsecognates.com started!</h4>

  <p>
    Hi! I am Fabio, the designer and creator of falsecognates.com. There's a funny story of how I thought of this concept. I am a Brazilian programmer who emmigrated to the USA in 2011 where I promptly met the love of my life, Natie! She is Colombian by birth, but moved to America at a very early age. Living in a hispanic community in NY gave her a very interesting cultural and language mix! I, on the other hand, was a Brazilian guy with very little international experience, so my reality at that point was greatly focused on the normal daily life in Brazil.
  </p>
  <p>
    We quickly started to hang out a lot! As you can imagine, it was not long after that that we started to notice several cultural and languange barriers. One day I showed her something that I did and that I thought was very nice, but she turned to me and said: "Ridiculous!", which made me a little confused! She seemed happy, but to me that sounded so rude! In Brazil saying that something or someone is "ridículo" is a bad thing. But the saving grace was that the first Bible passage that God put in my heart when I met her was:
  </p>
  <p class="bible">
    "[Love]... thinketh no evil." 1 Corinthians 13:5b KJV
  </p>
  <p>
    That word, "thinketh", in the original greek (λογίζομαι) literally means: I reckon, count, charge with; reason, decide, conclude; think, suppose.
  </p>
  <p>
    That passage has been a spring of peace and joy in our lives since day one! Everytime we hear the other saying something that sounds weird, rude, or just out of place, we try not to assume bad intentions, we try not to suspect evil intentions. We try to assume that it could be a cultural or a translation problem, afterall, by logic, since we loved each other, it was more likely that we meant well, even if we chose the wrong words by mistake or if it was something lost in translation.
  </p>
  <p>
    That became our game! We decided to make a list and laugh about our cultural and language differences, many times thinking of funny situations that could come out of it. Now, after many years of marriage, we noticed that many people misscommunicate because they don't understand those false cognates and culturual differences.
  </p>
  <p>
    We hope that this website, along with the goal of being an online reference about False Cognates, and even a place for entertainement, will help people all over the world to communicate better, reduce missunderstandings and encourage a loving attitude towards people that are different from them!
